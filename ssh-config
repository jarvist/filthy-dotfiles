# Jarvist Moore Frost; 2014-2015
#In levels of increasing subtlety, this ssh-config contains:-
#* default usernames / shortened hostnames for Bath / IC / EPSRC national
#facilities (bash autocomplete also reads these); this is more elegant and
#general than doing the same with bash 'alias'
#* Better default keep-alives, so that your SSH sessions are more robust to
#being closed (matters a lot on dodgy wifi) 
#* tunnelling over SSH via lcpu into bath.ac.uk resources (i.e. no need for
#a VPN to get to Aquila / Neon etc.). These are the 'xxxx-tunnel' shortcuts.
#* Master sessions enabled (further ssh / scp commands are tunnelled over the
#master session, stopping you hammering the login nodes. It's almost instantly
#fast to spawn another shell session, rather than TCP / SSH handshake, which
#means SCP command paths autocomplete just as fast as 'cd'ing' on the login
#node.)
#
#Nb: Rsync reads this file too
